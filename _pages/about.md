I am a fourth-year PhD student in autonomous surgical robotics at [Stormlab](https://www.stormlabuk.com/), University of Leeds, advised by [Prof. Pietro Valdastri](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/electronic-engineering/staff/863/professor-pietro-valdastri). 
I received my M.S. and B.E. degrees from the School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research focuses on advancing minimally invasive surgery through innovations in robotics and AI, specializing in three core technical domains:
1. **Perception**: Developing real-time sensing systems for dynamic surgical environments, including deformable soft tissue manipulation and laparoscopic image processing.
2. **Analysis**: Creating interpretable AI models for surgical decision-making through multimodal medical data characterization and uncertainty-aware learning.
3. **Action**: Designing adaptive, safety-critical control systems for autonomous robotic surgery, including motion planning and compliance control.
